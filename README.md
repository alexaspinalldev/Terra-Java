- **Design Rationale:**
  - [Explain key design decisions, such as layout, colour scheme, typography, and how accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG) were integrated.]
  - [Highlight any considerations made for users with disabilities, such as screen reader support.]
 
- **Reasoning For Any Final Changes:**
  - [Summarise significant changes made to the design during development and the reasons behind them.]
  - [Reflect on how these changes enhance inclusivity and accessibility.]

## Key Features
- **Feature 1:** [Briefly describe the implemented feature.]
- **Feature 2:** [Briefly describe the implemented feature.]
- **Inclusivity Notes:** 
  - [Mention how the features address the needs of diverse users, including those with SEND.]

## Deployment
- **Platform:** Heroku
- **High-Level Deployment Steps:** 
  1. [Step 1]
  2. [Step 2]
  3. [Step 3]
- **Verification and Validation:**
  - Steps taken to verify the deployed version matches the development version in functionality.
  - [Include any additional checks to ensure accessibility of the deployed application.]
- **Security Measures:**
  - Use of environment variables for sensitive data.
  - Ensured DEBUG mode is disabled in production.

## AI Implementation and Orchestration

### Use Cases and Reflections:
  - **Site Ideation:**
    - The name of the site was picked from a list of keyword provided by ChatGPT. DALLE was used to create the logo.
    - AI was also used to expand the user stories from the initial prompt describing the site's functions.
       
  - **Content:** 
    - Once the ERD was complete, GPT was used to create a JSON import scripts for the lists of Vendors and Coffees.

  - **Code Creation:** 
    - GPT was used to cross-examine my proposed ERD, suggesting new fields, and then create the model objects.

  - **Debugging:** 
    - Reflection: Key interventions included resolving logic errors and enhancing maintainability, with a focus on simplifying complex logic to make it accessible.

  - **Performance and UX Optimization:** 
    - Reflection: Minimal manual adjustments were needed to apply AI-driven improvements, which enhanced application speed and user experience for all users.

  - **Automated Unit Testing:**
    - Reflection: Adjustments were made to improve test coverage and ensure alignment with functionality. Prompts were used to generate inclusive test cases that considered edge cases for accessibility.

- **Overall Impact:**
  - AI tools streamlined repetitive tasks, enabling focus on high-level development.
  - Efficiency gains included faster debugging, comprehensive testing, and improved code quality.
  - Challenges included contextual adjustments to AI-generated outputs, which were resolved effectively, enhancing inclusivity.

## Testing Summary
- **Manual Testing:**
  - **Devices and Browsers Tested:** [List devices and browsers, ensuring testing was conducted with assistive technologies such as screen readers or keyboard-only navigation.]
  - **Features Tested:** [Summarise features tested manually, e.g., CRUD operations, navigation.]
  - **Results:** [Summarise testing results, e.g., "All critical features worked as expected, including accessibility checks."]
- **Automated Testing:**
  - Tools Used: [Mention any testing frameworks or tools, e.g., Django TestCase.]
  - Features Covered: [Briefly list features covered by automated tests.]
  - Adjustments Made: [Describe any manual corrections to AI-generated test cases, particularly for accessibility.]

## Future Enhancements
- Users can register and leave reviews on coffee roasts where they comment and rate the coffee on different metrics.
- Add a webstore component to the site.
